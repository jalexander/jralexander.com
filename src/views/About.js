    <AboutParagraph>I have a strong understanding of Javascript beyond using libraries and frameworks, making use of object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Currently I am building web apps in React and Redux using unit testing for clean, maintainable code. I am constantly exploring new frameworks and enjoy sharing my experiences with others on front-end standards and best practices.</AboutParagraph>
